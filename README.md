# PersAI Assiss
This is a personal project started, brainstormed, built and maintained by Andrew B. Vinh. You're welcome to use it as long as you email me for permission. 

PersAI Assiss or PAI Assiss is a personal AI assistant meant to help organize daily routines and schedules. With functionality to learn vocabulary, store information, plan events, reach out with SMS and hopefully many more things, PAI Assiss will be happy to help!


How to:

- Adding a directory to path
  - Add path to "dirs" in configs
  - *Chdir func WIP
- Adding a file to the toolbox
  - Create file in available directories
  - Add name of file without extension (ex: py.py = py) to "modules" in configs
  - Name and functions should be automatically added on next run
- Changing local DB/Config Paths
  - Config's file path should be changed in both pconfig and imports
  - DB file path is only in database
